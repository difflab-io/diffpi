# Infrastructure

## Overview

`@difflab/pi` is a [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/)-powered package with automated versioning, testing, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.

## Design

- Mise manages environment, dev tools, and tasks
- GitHub Actions drives CI/CD using mise tasks
- Org-level secrets avoid per-project secret configuration
- The build system is project-structure agnostic — only mise tasks need to work

## Implementation

### Mise For Environment & Tasks

Mise is the environment management tool and task runner. Since mise can manage a large array of languages and tools, it is a sensible choice for a language-agnostic build system that hooks into CI/CD and can be modified for any language.

Environment is configured in `mise.toml` under `[env]`.

### GitHub Actions For CI/CD

The `ci` workflow runs on feature branch commits and publishes pre-release packages for testing. The `release` workflow runs on merge to main, where `semantic-release` bumps versions and updates the changelog.

### CI/CD Secrets

Org-level secrets are utilized to avoid the need for setting up secrets for every new project. This means setup is only needed once.

- npm: `NPM_TOKEN`

### Cross-Platform Support

The project works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL) without requiring platform-specific tools.

Key compatibility measures:

- Mise handles installation of tools across host platforms
- Line endings enforced to LF via `.editorconfig`
- Bash 3.2+ required (macOS ships with Bash 3.2)
