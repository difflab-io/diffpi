# @difflab/pi

`@difflab/pi` provides tools and skills for the pi coding agent.

## Included tools

- `diffpi_validate` checks the environment without changing it.
- `diffpi_setup` installs missing tools and updates user configuration.
- `diffpi_reload` reloads pi after setup changes its resources.

The package includes structured user questions. Setup manages mise, Zellij, Helix, tuicr, Context Mode, selected pi packages, skills, and MCP servers. Linear and Jira remain optional.

## Included skills

The package bundles `diffpi-setup`. Setup installs these upstream skills globally for pi:

- Grounded Docs: `docs-search`, `docs-manage`, and `fetch-url`
- Simple English: `simple-english`
- Context Mode and its bundled skills

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@difflab/pi
```

Run `/skill:diffpi-setup`. The skill validates or configures the environment and reloads pi when required.

The setup tool changes user-level configuration. Run `diffpi_validate` first to preview missing setup.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/difflab-io/diffpi.git
cd diffpi
mise install
mise run install
mise run //packages/pi:test
mise run //packages/pi:lint
mise run //packages/pi:build
```
